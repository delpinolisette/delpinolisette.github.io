### [Graph Theory](graph_theory.md)

* Algorithms and Graphs

### [Numerical Computing and Analysis](num_anal.md)
* The Magic of Floating Point and the IEEE
* Why is NumPy any better than standard numerical packages? (hint: it runs like C if you vectorize!)
* 

### [Mathematical Cryptography](mathematical_crypto.md)

* Prime numbers, unique factorization, finite fields 
* Discrete Log Problem 
* Diffie-Hellman key exhcange 
* Theory of Groups
* Chinese Remainder Theorem and its proof 
* Rings, quotients, polynomials, and finite fields
