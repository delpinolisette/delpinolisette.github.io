Hi! My name is Lisette and I'm interested in the intersection of math and computation. 

I graduated UPenn in 2021 with a degree in Math and have been working as an analytics manager for a research and consulting company ever since. This blog serves as the account of my personal explorations into problems from math and computer science.
