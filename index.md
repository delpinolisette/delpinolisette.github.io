[My Journal](journal.md), [My Reading Log](reading.md)

Hi! My name is Lisette and I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania passionate about the intersection of Math and Computation. Some of my hobbies include coffee, space documentaries, and investigating new technologies. 

**Link to my slides from a recent presentation**: [Cryptography](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdGkOsmxy2CyUJRVHIdzjVyykqI3To42/view?fbclid=IwAR3VM03FceUloxVeDge2JDqKOYtu4hkWEx-uqhDgS_nINv2S9eHKC78kZdU)


## List of All Topics that I'm learning/interested in- grouped by subjects:

### 1. [Ruby on Rails](ruby.md)

### 2. [Advanced Linear Algebra](line_alg.md)

* Vector Spaces: Examples and Proofs
* Subspaces : Examples and Proofs
* Linear Combinations and Span
* Dual Spaces
* Jordan Canonical Form

### 3. [Mathematical Cryptography](mathematical_crypto.md)

* Prime numbers, unique factorization, finite fields 
* Discrete Log Problem 
* Diffie-Hellman key exhcange 
* Theory of Groups
* Chinese Remainder Theorem and its proof 
* Rings, quotients, polynomials, and finite fields
* Euler's formula
* Pseudoprimes 
* RSA cryptosystem 
* Primality Testing !!! So cool!

### 4. [Real Analysis](analysis.md)

### 5. Graph Theory

* Algorithms and Graphs
* Krusal's Algorithm implementation (in Python...) (in progress)
* Outline in progress

### 6. Numerical/Scientific Computing and Analysis
* The Magic of Floating Point and the IEEE
* Why is NumPy any better than standard numerical packages? (hint: it runs like C if you vectorize!)
* The Magic of Python

### 7. [Partial Differential Equations](PDE.md) :
* Derivation of the Heat Equation
* Seperation of Variables Technique
* The Fourier Series (NICE!)

### 8. Programming Tutorials I wrote :
* Get a web app running ASAP with Flask and Python [here](flask_start.md)
* Using Google Translation API to make a Python Web App that translates to another language. [here](flask_py_translate_api.md)
* x^n is even if n is even, and odd if n is odd. Here's a nice gif I made on Desmos:
