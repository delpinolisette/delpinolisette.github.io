# Hello! My name is Lisette 
and I'm interested in Math $$\cup$$ Computer Science $$\cup$$ Physics (and a ton of other subjects).

I am currently working on my Master of Science in Computer Science from Georgia Tech while working full-time as a research associate and analytics manager for a research and consulting firm. In 2021, I graduated UPenn in with a degree in Math, where I did independent reading and research on Mathematical Cryptography.

This site serves as my technical knowledge base, research log, and as an account of projects I am working on. 
<!-- This blog serves as the account of my personal explorations into theory and problems from Math and Computer Science. I also write about the tools of the trade - programming languages, frameworks, and tools I find interesting or use frequently. -->
