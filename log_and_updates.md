# Site Updates: 

2022-02-13:

The process for previewing and building the site locally are much easier than they were two years ago. I followed this tutorial: 
[Testing Your Github Pages Site Locally with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)

1. I wanted to preview the site before uploading so i could play with the css,

2. after making assets/styles/style.css, I made sure that jekyll was installed, ruby was installed, then installed bundler in the source repo by 
```gem install bundler``` , then I ```bundle init``` , then ```gem update``` all from the Git Bash. After this, I ran ```bundle exec jekyll serve``` to run the server. 

3. wanted to timestamp these so I installed [TimeNow](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Timenow). 

4. Ok so Jekyll was not installed, somehow. I got the "jekyll gem missing" error after trying to run the server. After trying to install it, I ran into some issues. Turns out GCC and Make are missing.

3. installed a nice color picker.
