I've had some time after work lately to revisit old but interesting problems.

One of my favorite counting problems comes from "Introduction to Probability" by Ross. 

It asks:

Imagine you have $n$ antennae, $m$ of which are defective. $n-m$ of them are functional. 

How many different linear orderings of these antennae exist such that no two consecutive antenna are defective?

# Step 0: Counting by Hand 

My first instinct with this problem was to set values for m and for n. Let's try some values:

# Step 1: Some Truths 

- m must be at least greater than n by 1. 
- you can't place your first element of m in the penultimate spot. 

# Step n : confirming our intuition by writing code
