I've had some time after work lately to revisit old but interesting problems.

One of my favorite counting problems comes from "Introduction to Probability" by Ross. This problem is interesting because the way that Ross solves it is not the way that initially occured to me.

It asks:

Imagine you have $n$ antennae, $m$ of which are defective. $n-m$ of them are functional. 

How many **different linear orderings** of these antennae exist such that no two consecutive antennae are defective? Assume that you can't tell the functional antennae apart from each other, and that you can't tell the malfunctioning antennae apart from each other. 

# Step 0: Counting by Hand 

My first instinct with this problem was to try out values for $m$ and for $n$. To make seeing the pattern to this problem easier, I set $f = n - m$ to represent the number of functional antennae. 

Trying this problem out on some small numbers:

- 2 ways for m = f = 1
- 



# Step 1: Some Truths 

- m must be at least greater than n by 1. 
- you can't place your first element of m in the penultimate spot. 

# Step n : confirming our intuition by writing code
