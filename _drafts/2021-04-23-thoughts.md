# How should I read this?

## Steps
Step 1 : Look at Table of Cues/Topics and Answers/Subtopics
Step 2 : Start by reading what's most interesting to you 
  - usually this will be where you're weakest, and therefore where you should focus your learning efforts. 

Step 3 : If you want to use this page to study...
  - can use the cue table as a representative "flash card" set.
  - Ask yourself the cue/question on the left, and see if you can answer with what's on the right without looking at the page.

# What is an $R$-Algebra?

There's several equivalent definitions of an $R$-Algebra:

## Definition 1

Fix some commutative ring $R$. 

An $R$-Algebra is is an $R$-module $A$ with : 
- an $R$-bilinear map (usually called multiplication)
- this multiplication ($R$-bilinear map), denoted by $\cdot $ takes two elements in $A$ and produces one element of $A$ :
  - $$A \times A \to A$$

# What is an R-Algebra Homomorphism?

If you have two $R$-Algebras

# List of Examples 

## Example 1

## Example 2


# Theorem 1 
Sample theorem
