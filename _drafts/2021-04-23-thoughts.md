# What is an $R$-Algebra?

There's several equivalent definitions of an $R$-Algebra:

## Definition 1

Fix some commutative ring $R$. 

An $R$-Algebra is is an $R$-module $A$ with : 
- an $R$-bilinear map (usually called multiplication)
- this multiplication ($R$-bilinear map), denoted by $\cdot $ takes two elements in $A$ and produces one element of $A$ :
  - $$A \times A \to A$$

# What is an R-Algebra Homomorphism?

If you have two $R$-Algebras
