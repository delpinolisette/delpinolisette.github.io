Some evolving notes on Materials :)

# Overview of Different Materials

## Riveting vs. Welding Steel
- while welding is cheaper in terms of time and labor for steel...
- large distance fractures can propagate throughout welded steel and can cause catastrophic failure
    - in particular, discontinuities in steel were introduced by inexperienced welders in WW2 (see Liberty ship catastrophic failure)
- fractures in riveted metal cannot propagate large distances as they stop at the edge of the sheet of metal 
- welding is faster (used during WW2 cargo ship mass construction)
- riveting is slower but less catastrophic failure change in metal 
- BUT! Failure is important in processes and materials. Because of the faster iteration introduced by welding...
  - these observed failures were useful, since fast iteration happened, welded steel was improved by trial and error in a sense, worked towards removing impurities and adding steel reinforcements

## ductile metal
- ductile: capable of significant deformation without fracture
- ductile to brittle fraction occurs at certain temperature ranges (cold)

## brittle fraction 
- ductile to brittle fraction occurs at certain temperature ranges (cold)

## solid material classification 
- solid materials are grouped into three main categories, scheme based off their atomic structure
    - ceramics 
    - metals 
    - polymers 
- you can also see composites
- there are also advanced materials:
    - superconductors, biomaterials, nanoengineered

## metals 
- in metals, atoms are densely and orderly packed (especially when compared to ceramics and polymers)
- metals are surprisingly strong yet ductile 
  - in fact, when we zoom into the texture of a metal being cut, it looks like clay, see this video: [Cutting Steel Magnified and Slowed Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbTlRn3tSCI)
- metals have large amounts of **non-localized electrons**
    - there are electrons "floating around" / electrons not bound to particular atoms 
    - metals being a good conductor of electricity and heat are attributable to the property of having non-localized electrons
    - their "lustrous"/shiny-ness also comes from this (they are not transparent to light, explain what this means further)
