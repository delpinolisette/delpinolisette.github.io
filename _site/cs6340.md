I haven’t written here in almost six months, this is because I’ve just finished my first semester in the Georgia Tech OMSCS program, getting an A (96) in CS6340: Software Test and Analysis. 

I thought it was a great first class. I had done my research on the difficulty of the course using OMSCS Central (insert link here) and I thought it was very reasonable,  not too easy as to make me question why I applied to the program and not so hard as to discourage me. There was some light math, which I enjoyed very much, though I thought some parts of the course suffered from imprecision (see soundness vs completeness). Other parts of the course, like the Delta debugging and dataflow programming projects, were perfect precisely because they showcased algorithms worked on examples. And while most of the demos were on toy programs, the homeworks were more involved and definitely improved my C++ Google fu skills. 

<!-- I was surprised at just how difficult it would be to work full time and do part time graduate school. This is mot my first time working while studying, I worked work study jobs all throughout undergrad as they were part of financial aid package, but this was another beast, even with the work from home benefit.  -->
