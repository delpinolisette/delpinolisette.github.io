## Welcome to my webstie: home for my notes on the things that I love most. 

[Here it is](https://delpinolisette.github.io/)

On this site, you can find detailed notes on several fascinating courses from my undergraduate math degree, including :

- Linear Algebra
- Real Analysis

As well as notes from subjects that interest me that are not necessarily part of my degree, like :

- Ruby on Rails
- Mathematical Cryptography 
- Programming Tutorials for Flask and general Web Development

All LaTeX / MathJax formulas are rendered using JavaScript. 
I'm using the Minima theme as a base, but I've modified it plenty. The custom CSS is available on this repo.

This site also hosts several "meta-learning" pages, where I track what I've learned in my other pursuits or while building this site. To see this, check out:

- Journal
- Reading Log
