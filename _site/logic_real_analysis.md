# Logic, Set Theory, and Functions for Real Analysis


# Logic Reference:
- if $A,B$ mathematical assertions, $!A,!B$ negations of them, then $A \Rightarrow B$ logically equivalent to *contrapositive* $!B \Rightarrow !A$. 
  - try proof by contrapositive when proving $A \Rightarrow B$ difficult. Start with $!B$ and deduce $!A$. 
  - diffrent from proof by contradiction (assuming $A$ and $!B$ and deriving a contradiction). 

# Sets Reference
- avoid issues with "set of sets" by using collection, family, and set to denote same entity.
