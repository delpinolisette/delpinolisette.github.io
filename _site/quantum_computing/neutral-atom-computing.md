- ion computers
- superconducting computers 
  - Well-known commercial industry leaders use these, but they are not without their issues
- neutral atom computers
  - focus of the notes

## What are neutral atoms 

Neutral Atoms refer to atoms that have no net electric charge, meaning the number of protons ( positive change) is equal to the number of electrons (negative charge)

- neutral atoms are coming up as a good platform for representing and manipulating qubits 
  - (importantly, they are scalable, can allows for the construction of large programmable arrays)

## How exactly do neutral atoms represent qubits?

Neutral atoms can be used as qubits by exploiting their internal energy levels, such as hyperfine or Rydberg states. 

These are different, as hyperfine structure refers to the small changes in energy under a particular influence. 

Rydberg states are what QuEra is exploiting to acheive the two-level system. A Rydberg state is an excited one where the 

## What tools allow energy levels of Rubidium 87 to be manipulated?

By using lasers and magnetic fields, these energy levels can be controlled and manipulated to perform quantum operations. 

Individual atoms can be trapped in optical lattices or other trapping configurations, allowing for precise control over their quantum states

(need to understand this more later)


## what is a Rydberg state?

Rydberg state refers to an excited state of an atom where an electron has a very high principal quantum number (n). These states are characterized by electrons being far from the nucleus, exhibiting properties similar to classical systems, such as long orbital periods and high sensitivity to external electric and magnetic fields

## Why neutral atoms for neutral atom computing 

since they are neutral, they don't strongly interact with each other, so we can have large numbers of them (scalability)

Since the atoms are neutral, they don't strongly interact with each other, making it possible to trap and control large arrays of atoms. This enables the potential construction of large-scale quantum processors. 

Additionally, neutral atoms often exhibit long coherence times, which is beneficial for quantum computation (look more into this)

## coherence time for atom 

longer the time, the more complicated a computation it can sustain and carry out 


## what are neutral atom quantum computers 



> In the race for the quantum computing platform of the future, neutral atoms have been a bit of an underdog. While quantum bits (qubits) based on neutral atoms have several attractive characteristics, including the ease of scaling up qubit numbers and performing operations on them in parallel, most attention has focused on rival platforms. Many of the largest machines are built with superconducting qubits, including those developed at IBM, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Other companies have opted for ions, like Honeywell and IonQ, or photons, like Xanadu.

- attractive characteristics like scaling up qubit numbers (what does this mean)
- can perform operations on the scaled up qubits in parallel 
(how exactly)
- Currently, many of the largest machines are built with superconducting qubits 
- other computers have been developed with ions 


## What is the biggest barrier to robust quantum computation?

- The noise it causes 
- error correction is a hard problem and the barrier to doing the hard computations 

- classical computers have very straightforward error correction 
- but quantum computers are prone to noise in the hardware and have no way to correct this 
- (i need to see a concrete example)
> but before a platform can benefit from them, their hardware must meet some minimal fidelity requirements. For traditional quantum algorithms, the rule of thumb is that the error rate for the minimum unit of quantum computation – a quantum gate – should be below 1%.
