My white whale is the perfect information organization and presentation system. None of them are perfect. 

When I tried to cram an entire textbook's worth of information on one markdown file for this blog (hello advanced linear algebra page), I ran into the issue of how to separate topics from each other when they're so closely related. 

I thought I solved this issue by writing shorter posts which are a bit more conversational, but then I risk writing too little about a topic. 


The closest I've gotten to a perfect organizational system is a folder on my laptop, containing subfolders full of pictures, note scans, textbook pdfs, code snippets, etc. I want to see if I can bring this system + a guide on how to read it to a website.  

For now I will have to accept that I trade information for readability when writing on a blog.
