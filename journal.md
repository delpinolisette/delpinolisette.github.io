Today i wanted to figure out how to get fast at LaTeXing - which I hear requires creative use of key bindings. It turned out to be an exciting way to spend a lazy Saturday. 

Log:
1. Read an article on the internet called: “How to Get Fast at Latex” over at https://traviscj.com/blog/getting_really_fast_at_latex.html
1. Rabbit hole begins. Began typing up some notes on Sublime for a Web Development course I’m taking (on Many-to Many Association)
1. Installed package control to be able to use LaTeX Tools, a very nice package from what I read. 
1. Oh man, I’ve been using OverLeaf forever and never installed TeX on my laptop, so I began the installation of TeXLive which took over 3 hours!!!!!!! In the meantime I drank coffee in the backyard and spoke with some people. It’s a Saturday. 
1. Got some grades back for some old web dev  assignments. I was happy, and this inspires me to abandon my Sublime LaTeX adventure for the time being and do some more studying for that class. I went ahead and took a graded quiz for the same class that night. 

 Side thoughts: I should keep an updated reading list on a website to remind me of everything I have learned/ all exercises I’ve done. It might even help me be more careful about what I read (I should probably stop living in reddit threads in my spare time)

1. Gonna put pencil to paper with my Analysis problem set, this should be interesting.
