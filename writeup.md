### Introduction and Problem:

This project required the construction of a Hermite Interpolating Polynomial, given the data : \\(x\_{0}, ..., x\_{n}\\) , \\(f(x\_{0}, ..., f(x\_{n}))\\), and derivatives \\(\\)  
We can construct a Hermite Polynomial using the divided differences procedure, by finding
