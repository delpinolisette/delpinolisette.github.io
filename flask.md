### Getting a Python Web Application up and Runing with Flask

These are instructions for getting a Python web app up and running quickly with Flask. **On Windows!!** On MacOS/ Linux, commands differ slightly but can be easily found online. 

Why Flask? A micro web framework written in Python. It's doesn't have a databse abstraction layer or form validation, but it is quick and easy!
Also it was writtein in 2010 by Armin Ronacher (at a very young age!).
