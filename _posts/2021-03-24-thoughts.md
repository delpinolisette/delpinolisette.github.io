Some thoughts on mathematical notation coming up....

I am not a huge fan of how ISLR presents the LDA classifier. It's nice because you can still implement it from scratch but tracking down what each part of the notation means is not an awesome experience.....

Should all math textbooks have a little summary at the beginning of the chapter explaining each bit of notation? I think if I were every to write a book I would do something like that. 


(no more mathematical notation obfuscation)
