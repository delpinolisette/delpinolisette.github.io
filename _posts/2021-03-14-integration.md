there's some tricky assumptions about integration that need to be addressed

In optimization theory - need to be careful about integrating a function using usual methods - it could be the case in higher dimensions that your function is not integrable. to prove that it is indeed Riemann integrable, we need to show that the measure of the boundary of the region has volume zero . This is also equivalent to showing

- the region is a Jordan region
- the set to integrate over is admissible
- the boundary of the volume is zero


Also... happy pi day!!!
