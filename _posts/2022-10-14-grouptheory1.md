Let's continue our journey on the Dihedral groups of order $$2n$$.

First, let's establish a few things:

## A Note On Symmetry

As we go through these groups, we're playing the game, what motions of the polygon leave the polygon looking the same (what are its symmetries)?

Reconsider "symmetry" as a manipulation of the plane. Then you can rephrase the game of looking for symmetries as looking for *isometries* of the plane.
