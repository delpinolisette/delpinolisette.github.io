## What is the Goal of Maximum Likelihood Estimate?

- The goal of ML (max likelihood) is to find the optimal way to fit a **distribution to your data**. 
- MLE is the answer to the question "what does my underlying model look like?"
- when we estimate values we think in terms of maximum likelihood estimates for parameters that we care about, such as the mean $$\mu$$, or the maximum likelihood estimation for the standard deviation $$\sqrt{\sigma}$$
