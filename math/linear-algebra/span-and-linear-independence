# Span and Linear Dependence 


## Linear Combinations

- a linear combination  (or linear span) of a list of vectors, $(v_1, \dots v_m)$, is **itself a vector** of the form $a_1v_1 + \dots, + a_mv_m$ where $a_1, \dots, a_m$ are in the field $F$.
<!-- 
```python
v_1 = [1.5,4.0]
v_2 = []
v_3 = 
vectors = [v_1, v_2, v_3]
scalars = [a_1, a_2, a_3]
``` -->

### How Can I Tell if $v$ is a linear combination of $u$ and $w$?

How can I tell if a vector is a linear combination of another list of vectors?
