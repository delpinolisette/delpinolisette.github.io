title: Bases and Change of Bases
---

Post in progress...
Let's explore change of bases. 

## Definitions
The orthonormal basis definition :
it is a set of linearly independent vectors which span the space in question:
 $e_i \cdot e_i = 1$ and $e_i \cdot e_j$ = 0. 

thus, the standard basis in $\mathbb{R^3}$ is an orthonormal basis (0s everywhere except for a 1 in the ith coordinate place)

<!-- Question : WHY are there truly infinite bases for $\mathbb{R^3}$? -->
