<p>The process for previewing and building the site locally are much easier than they were two years ago. I followed this tutorial: 
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll">Testing Your Github Pages Site Locally with Jekyll</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I wanted to preview the site before uploading so i could play with the css,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>after making assets/styles/style.css, I made sure that jekyll was installed, ruby was installed, then installed bundler in the source repo by
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install bundler</code> , then I <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle init</code> , then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem update</code> all from the Git Bash. After this, I ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code> to run the server.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>wanted to timestamp these so I installed <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Timenow">TimeNow</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ok so Jekyll was not installed, somehow. I got the “jekyll gem missing” error after trying to run the server. After trying to install it, I ran into some issues. Turns out GCC and Make are missing.</p>
