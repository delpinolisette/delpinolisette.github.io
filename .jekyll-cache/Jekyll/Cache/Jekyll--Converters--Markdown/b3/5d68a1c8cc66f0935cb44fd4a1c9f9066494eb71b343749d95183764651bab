  <li><strong>intro</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>many important functions are defined using infinite sequences or infinite series. We need specific tests to study the uniform convergence of such functions.</li>
      <li>Some helpful tests are : Weistrass M Test for series and the Cauchy criterion, everything else is more specialized.</li>
      <li>for uniform convergence we deal with the vector space of continuous functions.
        <ul>
          <li>here the ‚Äúvectors‚Äù or ‚Äúpoints‚Äù are continuous functions.</li>
          <li>here the convergence of a sequence \( == \) uniform convergence of these continuous functions.</li>
          <li>This space is <em>complete</em> (why?) because Cauchy sequences converge within it.</li>
          <li>Thus space has the <em>Arzela-Ascoli</em> theorem applied in it, which talks about compactness of some subsets.</li>
          <li>The <em>Stone Weistrass Theorem</em> is also useful here, it allows you to approximate continuous functoins by series.</li>
          <li>The contraction mapping principle leads the way to applications to integration and differentiation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pointwise and Uniform Convergence:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>pointwise is the most natural way to think about convergence.
        <ul>
          <li>(why?) because we only ask for each point \(x\) in the domain the sequence \(f_{k}(x)\) converges.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>pointwise convergence</strong> (def) :
        <ul>
          <li>\(N\) is a metric space. A is a set. \(f_{k} : A \mapsto N\) for \(k = 1,2,3‚Ä¶..\)</li>
          <li>then the sequence of functions \(f_{k}\) is said to converge pointwise/ converge simply to a function \(f : A \mapsto N\) if‚Ä¶
            <ul>
              <li>for each \(x \in A\),</li>
              <li>\(f_{k}(x) \mapsto f(x)\) (convergences to f(x) as a sequence in the metric space N) (QUESTION: revisit convergence in metric spaces)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>so the ‚Äúpoint‚Äù f is the point of convergence of the sequence of ‚Äúpoints‚Äù \(f_{k}(x)\).</li>
          <li>When does pointwise conv not help?
            <ul>
              <li>f, the function the sequence converges to, does not need to be contunuous, even if the \(f_{k}\) are cont.
                <ul>
                  <li>ex: consider this function:</li>
                  <li><img src="/gif/function1.gif" alt="example function" /></li>
                  <li>so the limit function is defined as \(f(x)\) = \( \begin{cases} 
  1 &amp; x=0 \<br />
  0 &amp; x &gt; 0 
  \end{cases} \), but this is discontinuous, even though each \(f_{k}(x)\) is continuous. Here convergence relies on choice of x, we need bigger k for smaller x.</li>
                  <li>We ask then for uniformity of closeness, regardless of the x value.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>EXERCISE (5.1) (a): if \(f_{k} \mapsto f\) (pointwise) and \(g_{k} \mapsto g\) (pointwise), then prove that \(f_{k} + g_{k} \mapsto f + g\)(pointwise) for functions \(f,g \in \)</li>
  <li><strong>uniformly continuous</strong></li>
</ul>
