<p>Do you like group theory?</p>

<p>I‚Äôd like to start a series of expository blog posts that ‚Äúclimb up the chain‚Äù of the dihedral groups of order \(2n\) (as in, what do these groups visually look like as we vary \(n\) from \(1\) to \(n\)) in way more detail than what I‚Äôve found in textbooks and other online resources.</p>

<p>A danger to this is some readers will find this exercise uninteresting since the dihedral group (in particular \(D_8\), the group of symmetries of the square under reflection \(s\) and rotation \(r\)) is one of the first examples of groups in a ton of textbooks, but I have yet to find a comprehensive walkthrough of the first few \(n\) for \(D_{2n}\) (this is because in almost all references, \(D_{2n}\) is defined for \(n\geq 3\), but the presentation still holds for lower group orders).</p>

<p>First, let‚Äôs name names: When I say \(D_{2n}\) I mean the group of symmetries of the \(n\)-gon in Euclidian space under the operations of translation and reflection, for \(n \geq 3\). For \(n=1,2\), I will call them \(D_1\) and \(D_2\), respectively (in the geometric convention).</p>

<p>I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all been presented with pictures of polygons as children and been asked to count its symmetries. Well, the formal exploration of these groups is just like that, except we‚Äôre going to find additional sub-structure on these symmetries in the form of subgroups.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs what the interesting question here is: Given a dihedral group, what are its subgroups?</p>

<p>I hope to build up to this fairly quickly, at least as fast as I‚Äôm presenting them.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start.</p>

<h2 id="d_2-or-d_1---dihedral-group-of-order-2">\(D_2\) or \(D_1\) - Dihedral Group of Order 2</h2>

<p>Here we start with the case that \(n=1\), so \(D_{2n}\) = \(D_2\). This group is also called \(D_1\) (that‚Äôs the geometric convention).</p>

<p>This the group of the symmetries of the \(1\)-sided polygon in Euclidian Space, under the operations of reflection or rotation.</p>

<p>The only possible move here is to ‚Äúswitch the vertices‚Äù, or reflect across the midpoint of the polygon. Equivalently, you can rotate the line \(180\) degrees about the midpoint and get the same symmetry. In either case, let‚Äôs call the operation ‚Äúswitching the vertices‚Äù.</p>

<p>So, the group \(G = D_{2n}\)/\(D_n\) when \(n=1\) looks like the set of these two symmetries:</p>

<p>And the binary operations of this group are reflection/rotation as described above, and identity (leaving the \(1\)-sided polygon as is).</p>

<p>They also call \(D_{2}\) or \(D_{1}\)  the symmetry group of the line segment.</p>

<h3 id="presentation-of-d_2-or-d_1">Presentation of \(D_2\) or \(D_1\)</h3>

<p>Formally, we have that the only two elements of the group are identity (seen above) and switching the edges/reflection across the midpoint/rotation by \(180\) degrees. Thus, \(D_2\) or \(D_1 = \{d \}\)</p>

<h2 id="what-about-subgroups">What About Subgroups?</h2>

<p>By Langrage‚Äôs Theorem, we have that the order of any possible subgroups must divide the order of the group. So the only possible subgroups have orders \(1,2\).</p>

<!-- Trivial subgroup of identity -->

<h2 id="a-note-on-the-1-sided-polygon">A Note on the $1$ sided polygon</h2>

<p>In Artin‚Äôs <em>Algebra</em>, he describes the 1-gon as a single node with a loop. Like so,</p>
