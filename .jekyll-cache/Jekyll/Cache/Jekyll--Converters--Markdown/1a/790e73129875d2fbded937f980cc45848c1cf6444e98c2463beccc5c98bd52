<p>There are some tricky assumptions about integration that need to be addressed:</p>

<p>We know this from optimization theory - we need to be careful about integrating a function using usual methods - it could be the case in higher dimensions that a function is <strong>not</strong> integrable.</p>

<p>To prove that it is indeed Riemann integrable, we need to show that the measure of the boundary of the region has volume zero . This is also equivalent to showing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the region is a Jordan region <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1251627/jordan-region-problem">(what’s that?)</a>, or that</li>
  <li>the set to integrate over is admissible, or that</li>
  <li>the boundary of the volume to integrate is zero</li>
</ul>

<p>Also… happy pi day!!!</p>
