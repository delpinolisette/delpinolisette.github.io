Letâ€™s explore change of bases.</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>The orthonormal basis definition :
it is a set of linearly independent vectors which span the space in question:
 $e_i \cdot e_i = 1$ and $e_i \cdot e_j$ = 0.</p>

<p>thus, the standard basis in $\mathbb{R^3}$ is an orthonormal basis (0s everywhere except for a 1 in the ith coordinate place)</p>

<!-- Question : WHY are there truly infinite bases for $\mathbb{R^3}$? -->
