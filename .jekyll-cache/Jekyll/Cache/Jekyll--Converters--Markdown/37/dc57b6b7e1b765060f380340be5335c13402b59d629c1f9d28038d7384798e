<p>Happy July, Lisette. Today is a day of sharpening my Web Dev skills. I‚Äôm playing around with the styling of the site, and exploring Githib Pages‚Äô powerful connection with Ruby. I‚Äôve installed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundler</code> and now I‚Äôm off!</p>

<p>I was happy with how the semester turned out!
Now I have my sights on sharpening my Data Structures skills, by practicing implementing algorithms from graph theory in several different languages.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve also been thinking about how one can glean an incredible amount of mathematical or computational insight from trying to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù something or testing really strange edge cases. In truth, this is what makes math and programming so fun to me. More thoughts coming soon.</p>

<p>Today I finished a long problem set for Analysis. While investigating answers on Desmos and Wolfram, I found some subtleties that were hard to see through algebraic manipulations alone.</p>

<p>Notice that \(\lim_{x \to +\infty} f(x)\), where f(x) is the mean of order s, where a and b are constatns, depends on the values of a and b:</p>

<p>Today‚Äôs goal is to finish some problems I started last week and do lots of reading for Math. I‚Äôd also like to run today (indoors of course!).</p>

<p>Log:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Trying not to think about how bad the Coronavirus is getting. I‚Äôve been doing my part by staying home, cleaning everything with bleach, and washing my hands with fervor. It‚Äôs been a surprisingly peaceful time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Today‚Äôs goal is to get ready for the week by finishing (and starting) some problem sets due soon.</p>

<p>Log.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Gonna put pencil to paper with my Analysis problem set, this should be interesting.
    <ul>
      <li>Trying to crack the problem set leads me to revisit Taylor‚Äôs Formula, Little o notation, and Jensen‚Äôs Rule. Notes coming soon.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Analysis problem set is taking much longer than expected. At night I switched gears and read for Linear Algebra. Those notes are coming soon as well. There‚Äôs something intoxicating about reading a math textbook at a calm pace, making sure you understand every line, and slowly building up to a bigger picture. I‚Äôll continue in the morning.</li>
</ol>

<p>Today i wanted to figure out how to get fast at LaTeXing - which I hear requires creative use of key bindings. It turned out to be an exciting way to spend a lazy Saturday.</p>

<p>Log:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Read an article on the internet called: ‚ÄúHow to Get Fast at Latex‚Äù over <a href="https://traviscj.com/blog/getting_really_fast_at_latex.html">here</a></li>
  <li>Rabbit hole begins. Began typing up some notes on Sublime for a Web Development course I‚Äôm taking (on Many-to Many Association)</li>
  <li>Installed package control to be able to use LaTeX Tools, a very nice package from what I read.</li>
  <li>Oh man, I‚Äôve been using OverLeaf forever and never installed TeX on my laptop, so I began the installation of TeXLive which took over 3 hours!!!!!!! In the meantime I drank coffee in the backyard and spoke with some people. It‚Äôs a Saturday.</li>
  <li>Got some grades back for some old web dev  assignments. I was happy, and this inspires me to abandon my Sublime LaTeX adventure for the time being and do some more studying for that class. I went ahead and took a graded quiz for the same class that night.</li>
</ol>

<p>Side thoughts: I should keep an updated reading list on a website to remind me of everything I have learned/ all exercises I‚Äôve done. It might even help me be more careful about what I read (I should probably stop living in reddit threads in my spare time)</p>
