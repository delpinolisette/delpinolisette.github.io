<p>Let’s continue our journey on the Dihedral groups of order \(2n\).</p>

<p>First, let’s establish a few things:</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-symmetry---just-isometry">A Note On Symmetry - Just Isometry</h2>

<p>As we go through these groups, we’re playing the game, what motions of the polygon leave the polygon looking the same (what are its symmetries)?</p>

<p>Reconsider “symmetry” as a manipulation of the plane. Then you can rephrase the game of looking for symmetries as looking for <em>isometries</em> of the plane.</p>

<h2 id="d_4-the-2-sided-polygon">\(D_4\), the \(2\)-sided polygon</h2>

<p>This group is the case when \(n=2\), then the total order of the group is \(4\). The operations are still identity, reflection, and rotation.</p>

<p>It is important to note that this \(2\)-gon has 2 vertices and 2 edges, meaning the two vertices do NOT share an edge, unlike the \(1\)-sided polygon. While I draw them as curved edges, this is only a representation of otherwise very close straight lines.</p>

<p>This group is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group, this also means that the group is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2 :)</p>

<!-- establish isomorphism for klein 4 group-->

<!-- establish isomorphism for cyclic group of order 2 -->
