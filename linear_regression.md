Some thoughts on linear regression :

- the math behind it is pretty intuitive - this makes it a good introduction to the world of predictive models. 
  - with some calculus you can find a closed formula for finding coefficients in simple linear regression, which is pretty nice.  
- the linear in the name refers not to the shape of the model that you find (even though for simple cases it is often a line) but rather that the variables relate **linearly** to each other. 
  - This should definitely be more clear for beginners!!! ISLR does a good job of showing polynomials as valid models from linear regression.
